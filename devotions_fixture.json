            "content": "A benediction seems to be an appropriate way to end this series. It began over two years ago and there are over 700 devotionals in the collection. There was a two-fold purpose behind the exercise. 1) I had grown increasingly aware that my morning time with God had gotten into a rut. I needed a fresh way to breathe life into my quiet time. 2) I wanted to leave a legacy for our children and grandchildren of how I interacted with God. Along the way, the list of recipients grew. It's my prayer that these short devotionals were of benefit to you. Thank you for letting me be a small part of your life. Remember, He loves you with an everlasting love. Keep looking up."

Looking back almost always slows us down. We run faster, and straighter when we drop the burdens of the past. Fix our eyes on the finish line ahead; there is a prize waiting. When the finish line is crossed, the pain of the past will be resolved and dissolved; yesterday's joy will be extended and expanded into eternity."

Observers wonder if the task will be completed, when suddenly the Potter turns the clay in on itself and starts the process all over again. After carefully molding it into shape, different colored glazes are applied and the clay is inserted into the oven. The finished product will be perfect for its intended use. Look around at the various vessels he is creating. Regardless of the stage they are in the Potter has an intention for each work in progress. He will work on the clay until it fits his purpose and won't stop until it is done. We can place our confidence in him for he is faithful. Let's go for another spin today."

If the Holy Spirit is to \"bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you\" (John 14:26), then it's important that what he said be in our hearts and minds to begin with. Alongside the information in Scripture, we must strive to know what it means. Knowledge + insight = abundant love.

Pray also for me, that whenever I speak, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains.

            "content": "When in a conversation with people, whether they are believers or not, and the conversation turns to pointing out the faults of the church or Christians, look for an opportunity to shift the conversation. Ask the question, \"Without referencing the church and believers, what has Jesus ever done or said that you take issue with?\" Most people would find it difficult to respond. This provides a chance to speak to them about the mystery of the gospel. The shortcoming of unbelievers, believers, the church, and the world in general, is precisely why Jesus came. It is a mystery that God would want to save the muddled mess that continually rejects his grace. And yet, here we are. The Apostle asks for prayer-- prayer in the Spirit. Prayer is essential for witness on the giving and receiving end; it opens our eyes and leaves us in awe at the mystery of God's loves for us, regardless of which side of the Cross we are on. He offers saving grace to one, and sanctifying grace to the other. This is the mystery of the message and the message of the mystery. It is always the need of the hour and must be delivered boldly, and unapologetically."

Every death is to be honored and every casualty is a profound and priceless loss. One day we will live in a time and place where wars will cease, but until then we must be prepared for war. On the spiritual battlefield where we fight for souls, God has provided offensive weapons to fight, and defensive armor to minimize casualties. Defensive armor has been credited for many soldiers coming back home alive. Be vigilant, get dressed, march forward to conquer. Stand against the enemy when he tries to reclaim the territory we've taken. We'll need all the help He can give, and he has provided all we need. The victory is ours, because the battle is the Lord's."

When we access and appropriate the power of God, there is no obstacle or enemy that can stand in our way. It becomes our turn to inflict damage on the enemy. We can't do it in our strength.

It may take weeks, years, decades, but when it comes the answer will be sweeter, the wait would be worth it, and faith would be stronger. There is a flip side to this counsel that doesn't fit the script. Some have petitioned God for a long time and in the process have grown weary, discouraged, and disillusioned. Some have given up praying and have a noticeable limp in their walk of faith. They resign themselves to a faint hope that the issue will only be resolved on the other side of the Great Divide. So, we plod on hanging by a thread, the bittersweet reminder that His thoughts are not our thoughts, and his ways are not our ways (Isaiah 55:8-9), and that will have to suffice.

There is no need to discourage anyone from being fit or looking good, but keep in mind, our best days are beyond our short lifetime on earth.

Because we don't know our expiration date, and we are not promised another breath or day, our choice of how to live is constantly before us.

What harm can come from a couple of thousand young people, worshiping and praying in a small town in Kentucky? Gamaliel's advice in Acts 5 seems to be the order of the day. Let them be, lest we find ourselves fighting against what God is trying to do. The worst that can happen is that several thousand people will have a sweet memory of their experience worshiping God. The best that can happen is that the movement will spread and we'll have a genuine move of God like the First and Second Great Awakenings, Azusa Revival of the early 20th century, or the Jesus revolution of the 1970s.

Demosthenes, the 4th century Greek orator and statesman said, \". . .what every man wishes, that he also believes to be true.\" The ideals of the deceived are forged into selfmade moral codes of belief and behavior embedded in a foundation of self-sufficiency. The nature of deception is that they don't know they are being deceived. They are willing to die for what they have settled to be their truth, even in the face of new understanding. In our time, we are seeing the manifestation of a generation overfed on praise without substance. They fail to see their need of a Savior because they have been deceived into believing they are good enough and don't need one. They have no fear of God because he has been emasculated or dismissed. The overinflated sense of their own goodness deprives them of the need for repentance and receiving the gift of eternal life. This will not end well, except that God is still at work. As long as there is breath there is hope. Believers get to participate in exposing the lies and declaring the truth. It is the Truth that will expose the deception and set them free."

All other fears are learned or imagined. Whether real or imagined, fear can be crippling. Fear of the unknown is a unique challenge. It thwarts us from pursuing our dreams and aspirations, by imaging the worst case scenario that may happen, no matter how unlikely. As a result, we may be left wondering, what might have been. It is interesting because we often imagine that what might have been would have resulted in us being successful, happy, and fulfilled. Overcoming our fears opens a panoply of possibilities, but we need help. The Psalmist sought the Lord; he called and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of his troubles. The phrase \"fear not\" and variations of it, is found 365 times in the Bible. That's once for every day of the year. When we call upon the Lord, he unshackles us from our fears. He may very well show us that we had nothing to fear but fear itself."

The singing is phenomenal as 3 and 4 part unrehearsed harmonies seamlessly fill the air. Gifted musicians play on a level most of us can never achieve. Worshippers are pulled into a common, unified experience. God delights in each of us as individuals, but there is something to be said about collective worship. Interspersed in these worshipping congregations are the everyday people. They are swept up in the current of praise, blending in and adding their layer of texture and color to the songs. A Nashville church service is a glimpse of what the music in heaven might sound like. Join the choir of the redeemed. You can sing alone in your workshop, your car, or in the shower, but make it a practice to \"exalt his name together.\""

At the end of the day he would be assigned a page in the dictionary for each mark, and he would have to write each word, its definition, and use it in a sentence. Throughout the course of the year, he did a lot of learning, and enhancing of his vocabulary. The boy fell in love with words as it made him more articulate in his speech. Learning to pray and how to think about God is a lifelong endeavor. It is complicated by the realization that God already knows what we will say, and the thoughts in our hearts, before we even utter them. Words matter.

Any attempt to cover ourselves is as useless as weaving clothes out of fig leaves. The antidote for our weakness, shortcomings, and sin is God's forgiveness and the Spirit's empowerment to break the cycle of trying to hide behind accusing others who we perceive to be worse than ourselves. We don't always see our own errors, but God does. He offers forgiveness for the sins we know about, the sins we try to hide, and even those that escape our awareness. \"Search us, O' God. You know our hearts. Nothing is hidden from you. Forgive our sins and free us to walk with you unhindered, in truth and righteousness. Amen\""

Our latest attack comes from organisms that cannot be seen with the naked eye, but are capable of taking out millions of lives. It is a wonder we are still around. This Psalm provides a key to our survival; God's protection is available because His plan is yet to be completely fulfilled. So we pray, but not because we don't want to succumb to the inevitable, but because we want to be a part of how it turns out. He is our refuge equipping us for the challenges of climbing the mountains that stand in the way of the fertile, beautiful valleys in between."

If we win, he reveals to us that we have the ability to win with the experience we've gained from other previous battles where he was prominently involved. Win, or lose, we must fight. When the war is finally over and the ultimate victory is proclaimed, our scars will be the visual reminders and medals of our participation in restoring the Earth and everything in it to its rightful owner.

Do we pull out the stops and celebrate during good times and clench our teeth and fight through, or resign ourselves to letting the bad times run their course? That is one strategy. Or, we can set our sights upward to the one who overcame and now sits above it all for eternity. He knows the end. He knows how it ends. He modeled for us, by experiencing life with us, that our trials and troubles are but for a season. Hear the words of the Apostle Paul, \"For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.\" (2 Cor. 4:17-18) We don't have to wait for the sweet by and by when we die. His kind of peace and joy are available now, and last forever."

The litmus test to the validity of their attachment is the presence or absence of fruit. Sadly, many who are attached bear no fruit. These branches look promising but they steal nutrients and fail to deliver on that promise. In order to maximize the yield of the plant, the gardener must lopped them off. In contrast, we have branches that bear fruit. These branches are pruned to ensure all the energy from the vine, flowing to that branch, goes into producing fruit, and not into extra foliage that bears nothing. At the time of harvesting, the fruit is picked and the branches remain for another growing season. Those who are true disciples of Jesus are recognized by the fruit they bear.

The rules proceeded to grow in number as each generation of priests and teachers expounded on each of the 613. By the time Jesus came on the scene, it had become virtually impossible to live up to the demands of the Law. Judging and judgment abounded as people chose to become followers of various sects, teachings, or teachers. It was, and interestingly still is, a mess. Jesus spoke clarity into the confusion. He took all the Law, rules and regulations, and consolidated them into 2 simple, yet profound, truths. Love God, love each other. From that point on it would be the criteria by which we are to measure our standing and progression in the Faith. By following his two simple principles, believers stand out in culture and time, and are more easily identified as the people of God.

There were plenty of places to sit at other tables, but this simple act, done without complaint or fanfare, won me over. He demonstrated what we call today, servant leadership. The task of washing the guest's feet was assigned to the house servant at the bottom of the order. Jesus modeled for us that no task is too small in serving God the Father. All things were put under his power. He would never ask his disciples to do something that he himself would not be willing to do. The Apostle Paul's words in his letter to the Philippians remind us that we \"can do all things through Him who strengthens\" us.

The words of Gladys Knight come to mind: \"I'd rather live in his world, than live without him in mine.\" (Midnight Train to Georgia, 1973) The words of the great Apostle Paul also come to mind. \"I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live. . .\" (Galatians 2:20)"

Lazarus was the innocent recipient of a resurrection miracle, but he became a target because his witness convinced skeptics and seekers that Jesus was the Messiah, the Son of God. Lazarus was guilty by association.

They had complete baseball uniforms right down to the stirrup socks and full catcher's gear. One team from \"the other side of the tracks\" could only muster up support from the town's barbershop. The best the owner could furnish was t-shirts and used equipment from the second-hand store. Although outclassed in almost every aspect that doesn't matter, the kids from the other side of town managed to wrestle a second place finish. Then it was time for the awards banquet. It was a coat and tie only affair, but the team manager talked the league into allowing the second-place kids to come to the banquet. They arrived wearing the best they had, which under the banquet rules was not good enough. They were quickly ushered to a back room where they were each outfitted with a new coat and tie donated by a generous benefactor. Some of the coats were a bit loose, and others were a bit tight, but they proudly walked into the banquet hall, were seated at their team table, and blended right in. They had played the game, under the established rules, and although their circumstances were different, they were shown that they belonged. The Gospel offered to the Gentiles, is proof that Jesus has prepared a place for us at the banquet. We belong."

The saddest of embarrassments was reserved for the miner who filled his bags, headed into town to convert his cache into cash, only to discover he had no gold, only pyrite. His hard work and life's savings would be depleted, leaving him destitute and broken. The enemy of our soul offers us the elixir of a false joy when he tempts us with sin.

The uncertainty of life is not always an indicator or an excuse for our present condition. This is the case of the man blind from birth. He was in a place where we needed God to show up. Some around him were amazed and others scoffed.  It is important to note that no matter where he was in life, he was in a position to glorify God when Jesus crossed his path. Ignore the naysayers.

Something Jesus said and wrote in the dust resulted in a shift in the case of the woman caught in the actual act of adultery. We can speculate about what he said and wrote, but any conclusion is complete conjecture. We just don't know. But whatever it was, it resulted in her accusers dropping their accusations, turning around, and leaving the scene. Jesus extends his forgiveness while admonishes her to leave her sinful lifestyle. It is the expectation of those who are forgiven to live a different life. The accusers disappear and the record of the entire event is left in the dust for the winds of forgiveness to erase."

Churches, seminaries, and families are churning out people who receive the benefit of living by the book, but fail to see the Divine intention of the Book. Many are full of misguided purpose yet remain separated from the life-giving Source that unites faith and life. Rightly dividing the Word of Truth must ultimately result in knowing the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Anything less, and we've missed the point.

Keep being who you are and the right people will take notice.\" Even Jesus himself experienced rejection, but the right people noticed and they got the benefits of having a relationship with the Son of God, the Savior of the world."

Our initial encounter with God often becomes the primary way we relate to him. We have a tendency to paint a picture of God that suits our individual, peculiar needs, and we stick to it. If our first meaningful encounter with God was because we had temporal needs, we view him as a Supplier. If we were lonely, he is viewed as a Friend. If we needed healing, he was a Healer; but God is each of these and more. He is more than any one aspect of him we have discovered. The measure of peace and joy we experience in our lives is in proportion to how our understanding of him grows. If what the infidel Voltaire said is true; \"In the beginning God created man in His own image, and man has been trying to repay the favor ever since.\", we are bound to miss out on tremendous blessings if we lock into a limited understanding of the all-seeing, all-powerful, all-knowing, God. God is a mosaic of all the pieces we believe about him that are true. Our knowledge of Him is clarified in bits and pieces as new tiles are added to the picture. Expand on what you know."

He stayed in his lane and his success was substantial. It's been said that we stand on the shoulders of those who came before us. The prophets who came before John prepared the way for him, but John would prepare the way for the greatest prophet of all time. In fact, John introduced more than a prophet, for Jesus was also a Priest and King! None of us knows the full impact we will bear in our generation. There is always a likelihood some who succeed us will be greater, much greater than us. It would be pretty hard to beat the one who introduced the Savior of the world, but our task is not a contest.

This is the day when the Earth's pole reaches its maximum tilt away from the Sun in the Northern Hemisphere on its yearly orbit. We experience the longest night of the year on the Winter Solstice. Many of our traditions of observing Christmas are adapted from other cultures and time. In a number of places throughout history, candles and fires we're lit in observance of the Winter Solstice. It was a belief in the pagan world that these fires would stop the encroachment of darkness and begin to dispel the darkness in the coming days. Most scholars agree that Jesus was born sometime in the Spring, not Winter. Apparently some missionaries saw in this celebration, an illustration to teach that, at the darkest time of our existence, God revealed his light to dispel our darkness. In essence, they redefined a pagan festival. Don't be shocked, or be in despair. While the pagans tried to appease the god of darkness into giving them more light, in our adaptation we celebrate that the Light of the World has come! The Kings of the East are still on the way. Don't forget to leave the light on."

Suddenly, an angel appeared, unexpected, and seemingly out of nowhere. Light exploded with a radiance that expelled the darkness! The first reaction of a good shepherd would be to grab his staff and sling, to protect his sheep. But, the angel spoke and his first words were; \"Do not be afraid.\" He had good news, not just for the shepherds but for all the people. The long wait for the Messiah has ended! In a typical night, marked by obedience and diligence to everyday responsibilities, with the hope of redemption relegated to summering in the back of their hearts and minds, everything would change in an instant. The angelic choir had rehearsed, prepared to welcome the Redeemer, the Prince of Peace, the King of Glory! Most nights of our lives are uneventful, but not this night."

Traveling teachers and philosophers filled the air with their words of sophisticated, and often confusing, knowledge and wisdom. The lines for the census takers were long. In the midst of this hustle and bustle, and the cacophony of voices, Mary felt her first contractions. 90 miles away from home surrounded by strangers, and unable to secure a room, she was offered a stable, for there was no guest room available: not exactly how she and Joseph had planned it.

Their love for each other compelled them to trust God in a most unique circumstance. Together they pondered and waited. The fullness of time was coalescing seamlessly.

It was at that point and place the Wise Men believed they would find what they were looking for. They loaded up their caravan, laden with supplies and gifts, followed the star, and were led to Bethlehem...a journey of over 1,000 miles.

God gave the Amorites time, 400 years, to experience the consequences of rejecting him, all the while sending his prophets calling them to repent and return to Him. The timing was perfect. The Amorites were without excuse; and that was a good thing. The choice couldn't be any clearer. The Genesis story is a microcosm of the condition of the world. Fast forward another 1400 years, God waited until the fullness of time to reveal the seed of the woman. The conditions were perfect to introduce the Savior to the world. He could not have come at a better time."

Before a single galaxy was sprayed into the darkness of space, before our solar system was intricately choreographed, before the 3rd Rock from the Sun was carefully landscaped and manicured to sustain life as we know it, the Triune God designed the plan that would result in fashioning a people, made in His image, who would worship Him in Spirit and Truth. Then He spoke, and it all came into existence. For centuries history has plodded towards it's redemptive destination; it is all going down as planned. The Incarnation would set the path leading to the Crucifixion, the focal point in the history of redemption. In turn, the Crucifixion would make the Resurrection, God's definitive statement about his love for his creation; we would be saved from the penalty of sin. In the heart and mind of God, in the timelessness of eternity past, it all started before it began."

Of notable interest is that all these things have already taken place repeatedly during the cyclical course of recorded history. Perhaps we are more aware today because the 24/7 news cycle brings it to our attention in real time, but Jesus reminded us not to give these occurrences undue attention for there was one overriding thing that must happen before his return; the Gospel must be preached to all nations. Currently there are 195 countries in the world. Within these nations are people groups with their own language and culture who have little to no knowledge of the gospel. Of the over 8 billion people in the world today, evidence suggests that 1-3 billion live in these unreached groups. Efforts are accelerating to bring the good news of Jesus to every corner of the world and modern technology is making it possible for all to eventually hear. The wars, famine, and cataclysms will continue, but it will be our successful effort to reach the lost that will open the door to his Second Coming.

The religious leaders of his day knew they had reached a fork in the road. They must choose to be for him or against him. They chose a different path. Lest there be any doubt, while the plot to kill him was accelerating, the plan to bring redemption to the lost was right on schedule. Soon it would be time for his final proof. There would be no final questions to ask, only a decision to make."

If we carry a grudge, we accept an illegitimate burden. If we respond by fighting fire with fire, there's a good chance both parties will be burned. If we ignore the offense, it may fester, unresolved. Jesus reminds us that forgiveness is God's default. Forgiveness is not passive, it seeks to disarm a situation in the pursuit of advantageous common ground. The goal is to win the offensive person over. That takes time, courage, patience, and wisdom. It may happen on the third opportunity to forgive, or the 7th, the 27th or the 77th. Winning over an offensive person rarely happens by engaging them on the issue of contention.

Its influence still rules today. Jesus didn't ask the blind men for a detailed history of their malady. He didn't gather up facts, and conduct tests to confirm whether their blindness was curable. There was only one question; did the blind men believe Jesus could do what they were asking? When they replied in the affirmative, Jesus touched their eyes and their vision was restored. Even as the facts verified their blindness, their faith is credited for their ability to see. They believed, and they saw. Some things can only be seen if they are believed."

Jesus taught in parables: simple stories that carry profound truth. When his disciples would get confused or embroiled in debate as to what his parables meant, he followed his teaching with a simple explanation; complex truth became easy to understand. When the parable of life itself seems to overwhelm us, try the simplest interpretation of the story surrounding the facts. A futile search for a more complex, all encompassing answer, often puts us in a position of missing the simple truth that answers a universal question. Keep it simple.

There are subcategories under each, but these general categories have the potential to be life changing so therefore decisions are to made only after careful deliberation. Allowing the circumstances of the moment to rule can be disastrous. Jesus had a very important decision to make that would change the trajectory of his calling and the lives of his potential followers. Jesus retreated to pray. Sound familiar? It should; he did it often. But this time it was an all-nighter. He wasn't tossing and turning while laying on a mat in the darkness of the mountainside; His was a concentrated effort directed to his Father seeking wisdom and direction. When he was done, he chose twelve to live out a special calling. Twelve who would experience and then broadcast the purpose of His coming. Twelve who would change the world, but only after having their worlds changed. Decisions have consequences. Big decisions have big consequences.

Did they receive the reprieve from God's judgement with joy? If so, how long did they celebrate? It may be that God simply closes the story for us to focus on what actually happened and not speculate on the woulda, coulda, shouldas. The little book of Jonah focuses on redemption over judgement.

In our pain, we want to exact our pound of flesh. It is true; hurt people, hurt people. But the cycle of pain needs to be broken, and forgiveness is the cure. God's offer to the Ninevites, if accepted, would stop them from further inflicting pain on Jonah and Israel. Jonah chose to dwell on his previous pain and scars, forgiveness for Nineveh seemed unfair. Yet to this day, if we let go of our pain for a moment, we are reminded that grace and mercy triumph over judgment. It's as true today as it was then. Choose forgiveness."

Whether we are running away, experiencing a tumultuous voyage on a ship in an angry sea, if the sea is sucking us under and our lungs are filling with water, even if we find ourselves in the belly of a proverbial big fish, God is there to offer a second chance. Jonah didn't end up in Tarshish or on a boat, in the ocean, or the belly of a fish. Jonah took advantage of his second chance and obeyed the Lord. He wound up in Nineveh proclaiming the word of the Lord that changed lives. Take advantage of second chances."

From deep in the realm of the dead I called for help, and you listened to my cry. The engulfing waters threatened me, the deep surrounded me; seaweed was wrapped around my head. . . \u201cWhen my life was ebbing away, I remembered you, Lord, and my prayer rose to you, to your holy temple. - Jonah 2:1\u202d-\u202c2\u202d, \u202c5\u202d, \u202c7 (NIV)",
            "content": "A closer look at this chapter helps us understand how God fulfills his promise of never leaving or forsaking us. At first glance we see Jonah sitting in the belly of a big fish rehearsing what had just happened and making amends with God. On closer inspection we find that Jonah had his \"come to God moment\" not in the belly of the fish, but before he was swallowed. As the waters surrounded him, he could hold his breath no longer. As salt water was filling his mouth and the light of his eyes became dim, Jonah remembered and called out to God. God answered his prayer by sending a big fish to save him. The belly of the fish was a divinely appointed \"time out\" where for three days Jonah was able to rethink the consequences of disobedience. It was then that the fish spit him out onto dry land. When we turn our backs on God, he follows, even to the depths of the sea. When we are drowning in the sea of disobedience God is there. When the prospect of death is becoming clearer even as the light in our eyes grows dimmer, God is there accompanying us to death's door. When we cry out in desperation, God answers. He delivers us, sometimes in incredulous ways. He often sends us to a time out room to have our calling restored, and then sets us back on the right road."

            "content": "We'd like to think that, if the Lord spoke clearly to us, we'd obey without hesitation. In Jonah's case, he disobeyed without delay. He was called to warn the Ninevites that their wickedness was about to experience the judgement of God. Jonah did not want to go there. Was it fear that kept Jonah from going? After all, the Ninevites were a wicked people known for their extreme treatment of their enemies. Did Jonah fear that he would be wasting his time preaching to a people who weren't interested or even hostile to a message from an Israelite God? We find out later (3:2) that what Jonah actually feared was success. Although the Ninevites had treated Israel with harshness, contempt, and defeat, Jonah felt that severe judgment on Nineveh was called for. He also knew that in lieu of judgment, God would offer grace if they repented. We know the story. God steered Jonah to rethink his reluctance to preach to Nineveh. The Ninevites did indeed repent and Jonah was not happy about it. God operates under the axiom that salvation is always better than judgment, even when we think that judgment is deserved."

Facts tell us that: seas don't part (especially at the precise time they are needed to part), manna doesn't appear out of nowhere, abundant water doesn't flow from a rock in the middle of a desert, shoes and clothes don't last 40 years, donkeys don't talk, axe heads don't float, people don't walk on water, and it's a process to turn water into wine. All of the above are recorded in Scripture; none can be explained by facts alone...although that hasn't stopped many from trying. Twenty-one times in this chapter alone, the Bible uses the phrase \"by faith.\" Faith doesn't negate facts; faith expands the definition and understanding of facts to include that which we cannot know by senses and feelings alone. Faith acknowledges that sometimes the facts, as we know them, are not enough to provoke us forward in our pursuit of God. We see by faith that which cannot be seen in facts. The rationalist leans on facts, the righteous live by faith."

At first, the primitive belief may be difficult to identify or describe, but the idea begins when the complexities around us become almost impossible to explain without resorting to faith statements of some sort. For example, the beginning of life. Because all of life in existence has some DNA overlap, we make the assumption that it all has a common source. It is at that point where a step of faith is taken in connecting the dots. Anthropologists, botanists, chemists, and physicists, all take divergent paths trying to answer the questions of how and where life began. Even theologians and mystics get in on the query. All resulting in different hypotheses of the origins of life. In the midst of that quest is the yearning to know. The sincere seeker continues feeding that simple faith. It is there where the Answer can be found, and God would be pleased to reveal Himself."

We settle for sailing leisurely around a lagoon with a light wind at our back, barely leaving a ripple in the water. We tend to not want to stand out, or rock the boat. God has more. He has called us to man a warship sailing the seas, taming the winds, mastering the waves, overtaking slave runners, and fighting pirates. It takes a lot of expertise and experience to be a successful captain. We have our Captain. He knows the dangers and adventures of traversing the seven seas. He trains and equips his sailors and assigns them their roles. Some are deckhands providing auxiliary roles; others contribute learned and earned skills, and the experience needed to accomplish the mission.

Believers are called to a different objective, what is called: fighting the good fight of faith. Our destiny is to live and reign with Jesus, but it is difficult to fight and win a battle from a comfortable seat away from the front line of battle. If we fail to engage, it may be that we have reached a state of inertia. We need an intervention. We may need a nudge, a shove, a swift kick in the pants; whatever it takes to move us forward.

It can also serve as an eyewitness to steer our conscience. It's hard to deny that we said or did something if we know God was there. But lest we live in the paranoia of guilt, God also sees injustices against us, incidences that caused us pain, and the sorrow that leads to repentance. He witnesses our joy of being forgiven, and the peaceful sleep of a contented heart. Giving an account for our lives includes both sides of the equation, the good and the bad. Those who follow unrighteousness have much to be concerned about. But, for the faithful, the redeemed, the balance is calculated to our positive good."

It is there where the miracle abides. Think for a second; those creative, imaginative architects had a Creator of their own! It's not only the buildings, builders, and architects who are worthy of note; there also exists a cosmic Designer behind and beyond it all!

If we are honest with ourselves, we can only come to the conclusion that we cannot live up to God's expectations: we can't earn his approval; we can't buy it. We don't possess the intellectual argument to convince him that we are worth saving. But it is that gnawing inability to gain God's acceptance that is key to redemption. Allan Bloom puts it this way: \u201cMan is essentially an incomplete being, and full awareness of this incompleteness is essential to his humanity and ground for the specifically human quest for completeness or wholeness. Man must resist spurious contentment because it conceals his fundamental condition.\u201d Our discontent keeps us searching until we exhaust the counterfeit means of fulfillment within and around us. Our dissatisfaction drives us to look beyond our understanding, into the spiritual realm where God awaits, ready to answer our deepest cry. He gently, lovingly, and graciously, offers us contentment and completeness in Christ. If we humbly submit to his grace, we experience wellness of soul."

If we were to evaluate his greatness only on the scale of what has been revealed, he stands head and shoulders above his alleged peers. But, as the commercial says; \"Wait!

Neither of those conclusions would be a problem if there was a standard that would hold up tomorrow. But tomorrow may bring another seismic shift with its accompanying confusion.

The opposite holds true for those who chose to challenge and ignore the biblical standard of morality and ethics. In a time of decline, it is not a good choice to abandon the standard of truth given as a gift from God on high; instead it is time to double our efforts to cling to the truth and teach it to our children and grandchildren.

            "content": "\"My whole life flashed before my eyes!\" There is nothing like a close call, a near brush with death, to get the heart pumping. It is in those moments we realize most clearly, how fragile life is. As the adrenaline rush subsides we respond with relief, which often gives way to thanksgiving. We've been spared; we've been given another chance. Only eternity will reveal how often God stepped in to guide and guard us from unforeseen trouble. In those times when we are aware, we give thanks for his deliverance, for the tears we don't have to shed, for those falls we didn't have to experience, for the great privilege we have been extended to continue our walk with the Lord. Take a moment to be thankful today, especially for those situations where God has acted preemptively."

Whether free or imprisoned, rich or poor, male or female, God wants to save all who are lost, and all of us are lost. Those who are higher up on the societal ladder are not exempt. Parents, professors, physicians and politicians, all are in need of God's saving grace. The Gospel is for all. Resist the feelings of intimidation of people who have positions of prestige and power.

I was initially assigned to carry water, distribute towels, and pick up equipment after practice; I was subsequently allowed to take part in workouts and training. At the end of the detention the Coach gave me two choices; go back to what I was doing, or try out for the team. I tried out the next season and barely made the squad. Since then, we've trained together and some of you became stars, winning ribbons and medals. The best I ever did was a second place finish, but I was inspired by your commitment and encouraged by your support, to keep running. You lined the course at every meet where I ran a race, and cheered me on till I crossed the finish line. I am a better person for it. Four years ago I was given two choices: accept the consequences of who I was and what I did, or get on a different track. I chose to put the past behind me and join the race. I was not as good as others who were running, but I kept running because the Coach, and all my teammates who finished ahead of me, were waiting to congratulate me at the finish line.

On the last day the list of those who made the team was posted on the locker room bulletin board. The names were listed in order of the number of points earned to make the team. His name was on the list, third from the bottom. He dedicated himself to improving. By the end of the season, he was stronger, and faster, but he only managed one fourth place finish in all the races. He made the team the following season. Realizing his level of stamina, the coach encouraged him to run cross-country. His best finish was a second place against a team from a small town highschool that barely had enough runners to qualify. In his final year of track, the young man finished what some would call a non-stellar track career. He placed third occasionally, but most of his finishes were in the middle of the pack. At the annual team awards banquet, he received a team participation medal as did all all of his teammates. He approached the coach and asked him if he could say a few words to the team.

Kingdom principles flip selfishness on it's head. We are reminded that the last shall be first, and to value others above ourselves. Such radical departure from our human nature doesn't come easy, but it can be developed in small incremental steps. Win the battle over self.

Whether it is a timed pass to a receiver in football, or passing the ball in basketball until the proper player is in position to shoot, coordination and timing is key.

When it's game time, don't forget to run the play as practiced. Take your position, make your pass or run your route.

Her workmates had a nice celebration in her honor and all took their turn saying what a pleasure she was to work with, and how much she would be missed. The following Monday the employees returned to the office; all seemed normal except... It took awhile to get used to Agnes not being there. There is something to be said about predictability. Some claim it is boring, but a predictable, steady order holds together what would otherwise be uncertain. Our God is with us when we awaken, and he is there when we close our eyes for rest. He never sleeps or slumbers. His predictability provides us with peace, even when chaos is all around us. He is here as an anchor to life, and he graciously surprises us with donuts.

New songs are composed every day; the possibilities are endless. Music is an integral part of every culture. Music can set or reflect a mood. Some music helps us remember, some helps us forget. The sacred songbook of the redeemed captures the story and mood of the People of God. For over 3,000 years now, we have been participants through song, in their experiences of joy, suffering, healing, and triumph. The songs never seem to get old.

A relatively new employee asked the foreman if he could be allowed to look at the schematics. After about 10 minutes, he told the foreman he could put it together. All the others who had tried, laughed. The new employee was known to have had only a fourth grade education and could not speak English, but he had a talent, a gift; He could see hundreds of parts laid on a factory floor and knew instinctively in what order the parts had to be put together. It didn't take him long; he assembled the machine. He was featured in the organization's trade magazine and was promoted to Master Assembler. From His balcony in the heavens, God sees everything about his creation. He knows where every person, thought, and deed is, and how the myriad of parts fit together in his perfect plan. All our experts try in vain but can't seem to put the parts together to work as it was designed. We, however, serve the God who sees what no one else can see which allows him to do what no one else can do."

            "content": "Awhile back a bumper sticker appeared with the message, \"Jesus is Coming, and Boy is He Mad!\" In the meantime, He is compassionate, abounding in love, and graciously giving his creation plenty of time, whether a human lifetime or centuries of history, to receive his gift of unimaginable eternal joy and life. It is true that He will come back to judge a sinful people and reclaim what is his, but the fear of what will happen tomorrow must take a backseat to the peace he offers today.9/20/22Today's devotional in a nutshell:\"Turn to me and have mercy on me; show your strength in behalf of your servant; save me, because I serve you just as my mother did.\" - Psalms 86:16 (NIV)Queen Elizabeth II, former Queen of the United Kingdom, was laid to rest yesterday. Her funeral was marked with somberness and celebration. Her eulogy portrayed her as a benevolent ruler and a humble follower of Christ for over 7 decades. Those who knew her best spoke of her abiding faith as the the centerpiece of her life. She is succeeded by her son, King Charles III. His work is cut out for him. He was blessed with a godly mother and her influence was foundational, but He cannot claim the blessing of God through his mother's testimony; He must make his own decision to serve the King of kings. His legacy is to be his own. Rest in peace, Queen Elizabeth. God save the King."

Our knowledge and understanding of science defines them as the results of the laws of physics, cycles of nature, and not much more. However, it is difficult to deny the consequences of human decisions and how they contribute to the brokenness and dysfunction around us. We can do practical things to protect ourselves from the effects of natural disasters, but the confession and forgiveness of sins is exclusively a divine transaction. Restoration and revival are the fruit of genuine repentance. The societal upheavals, convulsions, and storms can cease if God's people will humble themselves and call upon His name. If and when we do, righteousness, peace, and joy can once again be the order of the day."

Children mature and often move away. Friends dwindle in number as they retire and move.  The loss of a spouse can be devastating. Our culture does not put much value on the elderly. All of this paints a picture of the lonely senior existing in a tiny, ever shrinking circle of loneliness. We must remind them, and eventually ourselves, that we are never alone; His presence is always with us. When we are on the verge of being overcome by the fear of being alone, we can always call upon the Lord, who lovingly and patiently comes to walk by our side in deep, abiding, sustaining, and refreshing fellowship. No, we will not be forsaken; we will never be alone."

In contrast, the good news of the Gospel was committed to writing with careful precision. Our Bible is eyewitness testimony in written form. What the writers saw and spoke, is what they scribed.

Instead of interpreting the Bible beginning from the simplest of premises, they devise complicated methodologies that reduce it to a book of fabled stories and moral platitudes. Their method of interpretation downplays the supernatural, dismisses what they don't understand, and diminishes the impact of the biblical narrative. Assemble these \"teachers\" in a room and the voices of disagreement rise to an unintelligible cacophony of confusion; but, in the midst of this babel, truth is undisturbed. Sincere hearts reject teaching that denies who Jesus is and what he came to do. He is more than a teacher, philosopher, philanthropist, or moralist. He is the Lamb of God who came to take away the sins of the world. This cannot be denied or explained away. Everything else is just noise. On this truth we must stake our claim."

That evening they went to church where a missionary from Bangladesh came to speak. As was the custom, an offering would be taken to assist the missionary. The young husband reached into his pocket, although he knew he didn't have much to spare. When he looked at what he had pulled out, it was the $20 bill. He began to reach back into his pocket but stopped short and distinctly sensed he was to give the $20 to the missionary. His wife nodded in agreement. When they got home, they prepared a can of tomato soup, poured a glass of milk and ate in silence. They both knew it was going to be a long two weeks and they had no clue how it was going to turn out, but they acknowledged that giving to the missionary was the right thing to do. She was 8 months pregnant. As they sat on the couch, his arm around her, they heard a small tap on the back door. At first they weren't sure if someone was there, but then they heard a car pulling out of their driveway. They opened the backdoor and found a box of groceries. Bread, milk, eggs, cheese, a pound of hamburger, there was even a package of Chips Ahoy cookies, his favorite. In the box was an envelope with a card. Someone had written: \"My God shall supply all your need.\" Nestled in the envelope was a $20 bill. When you are willing to give all you have, God supplies from all he has."

The Apostle Paul encourages us to: \"Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.\" (Eph. 4:3 NIV). We can start by rallying around the things we have in common while we work on the things we don't. Keep extending the boundaries of unity until our differences pale in comparison or importance.

But he had something that was unique. When he spoke, he exuded a confidence that was striking and appealing. People were amazed at his teaching; he taught with authority.

The more we experience Jesus in action, the more amazing he becomes. When he speaks, the winds obey, the blind are given sight, the oppressed are freed, the lost are shown the way, God becomes real! We have that on good authority."

Men and women have altered their course of life and left it all behind to follow Jesus. They may have started as simple fisherman, but history records that lawyers, doctors, business people, and others have answered the Call. The calling is compelling when understood from the Divine perspective. We need to be told, and reminded, that our lives have significance beyond our profession. Life has transcendent meaning beyond the mundane. Simon and Andrew responded to a higher calling with a humble recognition that the profession they had previously chosen, put an unnecessary limitation on their potential to make an eternal difference. Whatever we do for a living is only a means to fulfill our eternal purpose. God's ultimate calling in our lives is to make us fishers of people. A bad day fishing for people is still better than a good day at the office."

When they watched videos of the planets and stars, she would proclaim; \"I see the presence of God there.\" The section on physical anatomy elicited the response; \"The Designer has left his signature on how the body works.\" When it was her turn to look through the microscope, she exclaimed in awe; \"God can be found in the tiniest of places.\" Her teacher who did not believe in God, became increasingly impatient. He finally took the girl aside and reprimanded her. \"God is nowhere!\"; he said. \"Nowhere!\" He set up a desk in the hallway and instructed the girl to write, \"God is nowhere!\" 500 times. As the young girl sat alone in the empty hallway she began to write. After writing the 500 lines, she gently knocked on the classroom door. The teacher took the papers where she had written her lines and was amazed at what the girl had written. When challenged to recant her faith by denying God's existence, the girl declared her faith humbly, yet boldly. She had been instructed to write, \"God is nowhere!\" She responded by writing, \"God is now here!\" God's existence has telltale evidence to those who are willing to look. It is only a fool who says, \"There is no God!\""

His promise of \"life and more abundantly\" has ample evidence. He has shown his faithfulness in all of time and in every circumstance. It is because he is good that we can place our hope and faith in him. His goodness is the gateway to the riches of his wisdom, righteousness, holiness, and power.

Nothing is too big for him, nothing too small to escape his notice, and that is why his love is so amazing. We are a speck of dust in his vast universe, yet he invites us to be with him.

            "content": "From a moral and spiritual perspective it can be concluded that our nation, at present, is in decline. These words are difficult to write, but the decline is not unusual in history. Numerous nations and empires have come and gone. Either another more powerful nation arises to challenge and defeat it, or moral deterioration will topple it from within. It doesn't look good for us, unless you look at that same history and see that nations go through periods of decline and renewal. We have had several national awakenings, renewals, or revivals in our history. One such period occurred in the 1730s-1770s, before we were even a nation! Another from 1795-1830s. These were instrumental in providing early course corrections in the beginning of what is called \"America, the Great Experiment.\" Subsequently we have had the Pentecostal outpouring from 1906-1950s, and the Jesus movement from the late 1960s through the early 1980s. Can it happen again? Their beginnings can be traced to deep desires in the hearts of the People of God leading to fervent intercession on behalf of the nation. Although these renewals last only a relatively short span of time, they set the national tone for decades after. God has answered these prayers in the past. We can pray that he'll do it again. We need a national revival.Revive us again;  Fill each heart with Thy love;  May each soul be rekindled  With fire from above.Hallelujah! Thine the glory.  Hallelujah! Amen.  Hallelujah! Thine the glory.  Revive us again.  - William Mackay, 1863"

Thankfully his anger serves as a course correction and only lasts as long as needed for us to get back on course. Our discomfort and weeping are meant to reinforce the lesson that it doesn't pay to walk in disobedience. Our sorrow can quickly turn to laughter and our tears converted to joy. God's momentary displeasure offers us an opportunity to sing the praises of his holiness and goodness. Get on track. Stay on track. His favor lasts a lifetime."

But when we are challenged to compromise our moral and ethical convictions, fear of what others may say or do to us can keep us from taking a stand. Failure to stand often leaves us with feelings of shame and defeat. Having a firm grasp in the power and strength of the Lord fortifies our resolve to stand up against injustices and attacks from the enemy. As the Angel of the Lord told Joshua; \"Do not be afraid.\" Be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. The victory is ours because the battle belongs to the Lord."

Whether we willfully or unintentionally make a wrong turn, we are given opportunities to correct the course.

            "content": "\"Remember, It's not a lie if you believe it.\" - George Costanza (Seinfeld)  In our times, truth has become a moving target. It dismisses accepted standards and is subjective depending on the interpretation of an ever fickle culture kicking its heels against anyone or anything claiming authority. When truth rejects facts and reason, it becomes confusing and chaotic; everyone does what is right in their own minds. Conflicting truths invite inevitable collisions. However, the People of God have had God's truth delivered to them in principle and precept through the written word. The Word is defined as eternal truth that will survive the ages. It is an unchanging standard by which all understanding is measured. It is an anchor for the individual as well as for a society as a whole - \"the faith that was once for all entrusted to God's holy people.\" Costanza was wrong. A lie is a lie even if one believes it. The truth is the truth even if one does not believe it."

The invention of the steam engine and development of railroads brought about phenomenal social change. People began to move, and settle where they thought was the best opportunity to thrive: sometimes cross country, sometimes to another country altogether. The families and friends they left behind were occasionally connected by letter, telegram, and eventually a phone call. Media methods have grown exponentially to accommodate family and business. Whether by televideo, email, text messaging, or other social media, it is possible to stay in touch. But, there is nothing like seeing someone in the flesh. John wrote letters, but there were things he knew must be said face to face. Cherish the few times when we are blessed with a face to face encounter. Look into their eyes. Enjoy the twinkle in their eyes and absorb the warmth of their smile The loving hug of someone you love is difficult to replicate long distance."

At once he was made aware of the immensity of that love's ability to forgive sin, even his sin. He then went on to assist William Wilberforce in founding the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade. That's the kind of love Newton encountered - a love that turned his life around completely. Amazing Grace indeed!"

As the pile grew smaller the children at the end of table would have worried looks on their faces. The last child would sigh with relief as the brownie was set on her plate. Everyone had a brownie and there was one left over. Each child wanted dessert, and there was enough to go around. In the foresight of God, before he executed his plan, he scanned the future generations that would come after the creation of the first pair. He calculated the need of everyone who wanted and needed salvation and he filled the platter of redemption with enough for each one...and he added a little extra. Do not be anxious.

You see, we were not created to do anything we want, we were created with the ability to exercise self-control and not do everything we want.

We are not helpless victims of a shipwreck waiting to be rescued. We are a people fully equipped and prepared to sail the seas in search of new worlds to explore and enjoy.

Training can be mundane, taxing, and to a degree painful, but it pays great dividends when the demands of life call our faith into action."

The difference between one train and another is the quality of life the passengers choose for eternity. It is in this life we are given the opportunity to decide which train we're going to board and which city will be our eternal home.

His objective is to steal, kill, and destroy. Nothing is off limits in his attempts to get us to submit. He is relentless. But \"greater is He who is within us, than he who is in the world.\" God has equipped us with faith, hope, and the Word of God to wage war and win. We are to take the fight to the enemy and put him to flight. The best defense is a good offense. When we bowed to the Lordship of Jesus Christ, God turned us from victims to victors. Fight! Never, never give up."

If their vision drifted to the left or right their team of horses would inevitably start drifting in that direction. If they concentrated on their furrows by looking back, the rows would end up wavy as they continually had to make corrections. Focusing on the marker insured the lines were plowed straight. So it is with being a follower of Jesus. He is our marker. He guides the way on the straight and narrow path. The distractions of life will come, as well as the temptation to look back, but fixing our unwavering eyes on Jesus keeps us walking straight toward the hope of his promises."

Psychologists call it \"confirmation bias.\" But, what if there is another way, a better way? What if, the way we've been doing it is the wrong way? Progress requires change, but the promise of better results must outweigh the effort it takes to change. It all starts with an open mind. If we are comfortable with what we know about God, if we are cruising toward our final destination, there is a good chance we are missing out on how much more of God there is to know. Consider the prayer of the psalmist: \"Open my eyes that I may see wonderful things in your law.\" (Psalm 198:18 NIV) It may be time for a change."

He has plans for a new and better version of heaven and earth that will surpass the beauty of the present. It's hard to believe and even harder to understand how it can be any prettier, or better, but God has endless layers of creativity. He specializes in making something out of nothing. He created all we have experienced out of nothing. When it is all gone and there is nothing visible to work with, we know God has been there before and knows what to do.

Before the planets were put into orbit; before the 3rd Rock from the Sun was singled out; before the mountains were shaped and the finger of the Creator drew the lines of the shore and sea and the valleys and rivers; before the fish of the sea and the animals in the fields were crafted, and the breath of God was inhaled by the human form He gathered from the dust of the earth; it was all in the mind of God.

To be sure, there are doctrinal distinctives that define particular denominations or movements, but the fundamentals keep us rooted and unified as believers regardless of the label we wear. When exposed to teaching and teachers expounding about the Message, we must continually ask the question; How does this help us to understand Christ and the core of Christianity?

Conversion rates are being reported that are among the lowest recorded since surveys have been conducted. Church attendance is at the lowest percentage in a century. The telltale sign is the unraveling of our social fabric. That's the bad news. The good news is that the Gospel thrives and prevails under these conditions if the People of God humble themselves, seek God's face, pray, and share the hope that is in Jesus. The Bible talks about a great falling away that will take place, but it will happen alongside a great season of soul harvesting. We can curse the darkness around us, or we can light a candle. Share the light."

Temptation may come to follow another way, but the false choice of serving other gods always leads back to the wilderness, slavery, or the darkness of the loss of God's presence. Most of us would like to have the presence of mind to say something profound before we go to spend eternity with our Maker. Joshua's last words were familiar words: His last words were a reminder to his generation they had a choice to make. Choose life."

The defeat of Jericho elevated Joshua as a leader among his people. It was a boost of confidence to the nation that started as slaves and was now a seasoned, well prepared army. But the circle of respect and fear spread well beyond Jericho. The whole land of Canaan had been served notice: The God of Israel had arrived and he intended to restore the land that had been desecrated to false gods and evil people. Our individual lives are a microcosm of this great truth. Having been rescued from slavery to sin, Jesus (our Joshua) has led us into redemption and restoration of that which was initially intended to be a testimony to God. It starts with a collapse of walls and a campaign to bring all other resistance to an end. It may take a lifetime to complete, but Jesus, lead on!"

Joshua was to lead the cause to eradicate the false gods and reintroducing the true God who had been forgotten for generations.

For 400 years Israel lived in Egypt, eventually being subjected to slavery. When God raised up Moses, he provided them with a leader who would end their days as slaves. But it was also the beginning of a journey that would lead them to a whole new way of living. 40 years of wandering through the wilderness taught them how to trust God's ability to provide for all their needs. Finding themselves at the banks of the Jordan, they must have released a huge sigh of relief; their wandering had ended. But the end was also the beginning. They were now a people with an identity, the People of God. They would be engaged in forging the boundaries of a nation they could call home. The old adage is true. When God closes a door, he opens a new one; when God opens a door, he closes an old one. Each stage of life is both an ending and a beginning, a beginning and an end. When God leads you to the water, step out in faith and cross it. Both what lies ahead, and what you leave behind, will be worth the journey."

            "content": "Hindsight is 20/20. Some fool themselves about their past by being selective in their memories. They conclude that all was good based on their choice of memories. Looking through rose colored glasses is equally deceptive. By grading our lives on a curve we may be convinced every dark cloud had a silver lining. Depending on whether one is a half-empty or half-full kind of person, our memories can be easily skewed. A lot of the time our experiences were either good or bad, or neither bad nor good. They were simply pieces of a puzzle that needed to find their place. Context is often lost when our bias assigns a particular perspective to an experience. When our present steers us to yearning for our past, lean not on our own understanding. Instead, let us shift our attention to letting God interpret our past to shape our future, ensuring that today is one of tomorrow's good old days."

As wonderful as the sign of the empty tomb is, he also promised he would come again to receive us to himself and take us to dwell with God forever in a place where there is no sorrow, crying or pain. He said that too. And throughout the centuries, on this day the People of God greet each other with the words: \"He is risen!\" and reply, \"He is risen indeed! Hallelujah!\""

Although none of us can see it clearly or completely, it oversees our labor and provides the determination we need to keep working. We yearn as we toil. In due time, His time, He will resolve all of history in our favor. It began with the first coming of Jesus; sealed by his death, burial, and resurrection.

The energy expended on the responsibilities and demands of life can leave us depleted. We can relate to the psalmist. Many of us who are tired have employed the survival tool of self-encouragement. We repeat to ourselves different mantras: This will pass! 'I can do this! One day at a time!' We plow on, tired but determined until we break through, or break down. The psalmist knew the answer. He talked to God. 'I am tired, God, but I can prevail.' It is in Him that we 'live and move, and have our being.' It is in Him that we 'can do all things through Christ who strengthens us.' We are limited in our ability to make it through on our own, but we will prevail if God is the source of our supply. Keep looking up. That's where our help comes from."

The voice simply says: \"Go west.\" Eli doesn't know the final destination, yet obediently puts one foot in front of the other. He is met with violent opposition every step of the way. He meets it head on, never flinching or giving ground. Although he loses the book to the villain of the movie, unbeknownst to the villain he is thwarted in his plan to exploit the book for evil purposes because he can't read. Eli was thrust into a world of chaos, yet he marched on until he finally reached his destination, an enclave of survivors who are intent on structuring a new world, one of peace and justice. Although no longer in possession of the book, Eli had memorized the book. He dictates the entire contents to a scribe who puts it into written form. The survivors would be in possession of the tool that would help them build a better world. No matter the opposition, no matter the cost, in a world of darkness and dystopia, walk by faith, not by sight. Be like Eli."

This is accomplished by making a fair judgement in: acknowledging an established ideal, defining the violation, and determining the proper corrective measures. It is important that the judgment fit the level of the infraction. A proper order is necessary for a peaceful social order. But let's not forget to factor in genuine remorse when meting out justice. Harshness and vindictiveness erode the effectiveness of justice. Righteous judgment brings joy to the offended and acts as a deterrent to those inclined to break the rules. Thus, wisdom is essential to fairness. The weight of justice should persuade the rebellious to reconsider their thinking and behavior, and to the penitent, justice is tempered by mercy."

There is a tendency to be skeptical when poor people own television sets, automobiles, cellphones, and have access to government subsidies for many necessities. Add to that those who abuse a safety net system, and those who access a lucrative underground and often illegal economy, and it is easy to ignore or overlook those who may be truly in need. One strategy to address the needs of the poor is to help those you know directly, while also contributing to legitimate non-profit organizations who are often more capable in determining who are the truly needy. However, we must continue living prayerfully and discerningly toward the stranger. Resist scoffing, blanket judgementalism, rationalizing that we are already ministering to others, and the skepticism that might cause us to miss an opportunity to be a blessing. Don't forget, although reward comes with every act of compassion, the greatest satisfaction comes from being obedient to God."

With God's blessing, they can build on the successes and nullify the shortcomings of their parents. That is why grandchildren are such a blessing. It means you have instilled in your children the hope that the world will continue. And the added blessing? As we get older, our children realize what a blessing we were as parents!

Then the responsibility of running the business takes the forefront. The questions mount. Will the customers or clients come? The expenses surely will. That's a given. Anxiety and hope struggle for dominance but settle for an uneasy coexistence. Finally, the day comes when the business breaks even and then starts to turn a profit. There may be a short pause for a celebration, but then it's back to work. Learn the lesson of hope deferred. Celebrate the blessing longer than the lack of it was mourned, because fulfilled hope is the fuel that sustains and motivates while the next goal is pursued."

It was pride that led to the rebellion in the heavens when Lucifer declared himself equal with God. Pride is so contagious that it swept up a third of the angels in its horrid manifestation. It was so difficult to reject, that even when the cosmic battle was over, in defeat Lucifer took his pride with him and subsequently tried to carve a piece of God's realm for himself on earth. There are different manifestations of pride. This proverb focuses on the most insidious of all; the unwillingness to admit one is wrong. Pride must be challenged head on; no nibbling around the edges. Call it out, and deal with it definitively. The wise admit it, repent of it, and bring an end to strife. Blessed, and humble, are the peacemakers."

But the rules of the Kingdom define life using a different standard. \"Life goes on\" is not resignation to the inevitability of present circumstances, it is instead a declaration of hope that whatever is going on is not the end at all. Those who have surrendered to the lordship of the Christ, are recipients of the gift of eternal life. Because we live on an eternal plane, we can count on complete resolution to anything we encounter. It will make sense. It will have been worth it.

A number of pedestrians brush him off, some answer no, as they don't even slow their gait, and others make no eye contact at all. The young man then approaches a disheveled, homeless man who is slowly eating a sandwich while sitting on the sidewalk with his back resting against a building. He asks the homeless man for a dollar. The old man looks at him for a second with a puzzled look, reaches into his pocket and pulls out a ragged, crumpled, dollar bill and hands it to the young man. It is then that the young man reveals his experiment to the homeless man and springs the surprise by giving him $500. The homeless man tries to wave off the money, but the young man insisted until the homeless man finally, sheepishly, accepts. The young man went on to ask him why he, who was obviously in need of the dollar, reached into his pocket to give it away. The homeless man answered, \"You said you were hungry, and I know how that feels.\" It rarely works that tangibly in real life, but the refreshment in the giving is as sweet as in the getting. Being generous is a reward in itself. Being generous while being in need yourself, is off the charts!"

While there is satisfaction in what we do know, the half has yet to be revealed. Take another step today to add wisdom to your understanding and righteousness to your knowledge. There is still more to be known."

Later in life he was asked to summarize the biggest lesson he had learned. He responded by saying that he was saddened by how much of his life he had lived dependent on his own abilities. While it is not arrogant to employ one's mind, strength, and personality in pursuing the plan of God, these traits yield much better results when humbly submitted to the Lord's direction. The proverb goes on to say, \"in all your ways acknowledge him.\" It is still good advice today."

They know intricate details about each other: their favorite song, food, color, strengths and weaknesses. Of all the people in the world, they would each choose the other to spend time with. It's the type of relationship the Lord of the Universe wants to have with each of us. As Creator, he has had a head start in knowing us. He desires to reveal himself to us not only in splendor, majesty, and strength, but also in depth, intimacy, and love. Such thought is too lofty to entertain, but it's what we want, and he knows that."

I visit the bakery and buy a chocolate cake donut like I used to. The empty lot where we played baseball is gone now, but the memories linger and are still vivid. I mostly remember the good; there is more, so much more, but I have filed away most of the bad memories to the deepest recesses of my mind. More than once I recall the words, \"Don't forget where you came from, especially if you make it big.\" Well, I never made it to the big show, but I haven't forgotten where I came from, or who made me. That neighborhood and those people are cherished by me. I don't have a perch that is lofty or far, but if I did, I hope I don't forget those who don't. God became flesh, he dwelt amongst us in our humble estate. He is now high and lifted up and remembers those of us who are still in that lower place. The thought warms my heart even more than a nostalgic trip to the old neighborhood."

            "content": "Twenty-six times in this Psalm we are reminded that God's love endures forever. Why? It is because; it bears repeating, we may not have understood it the first 20 times, our faith is weak and needs bolstering, it is sweet music to our years, and we can never hear it enough. God repeats himself because what he is trying to communicate is extremely  important. Not only does he repeat himself in words, but also in his actions. He frames out a new day to remind us that life goes on; we have another chance to build, another opportunity to fix, adjust, or adapt. He follows it with night, because we need rest, rejuvenation, and the reminder that while we are asleep, he continues to move his plan forward. He most often uses us during the day, or night, but very rarely both. Examine the patterns of repetition of life and we'll find that God speaks clearly, and repeats himself often. His love endures forever and his faithfulness to all generations. Thank him for his reminders."

Dissension and disagreement have deeper roots than what seems obvious. They are often a quest for one person to have their way, to convince the other person they are wrong. But uniformity of thought is different than unity. If two people or parties agreed on everything, one of them is unnecessary. Different perspectives yield a more comprehensive approach to problem solving. True harmony focuses on the goal. Common ground becomes the basis for forging an agreement. Unity is the result of discussions, discernment, and adjustments that are made to reach the desired goal. Endeavor to \"keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace...\" (Eph. 4:3) Where there is unified partnership it is indeed a good and pleasant thing to behold."

The mirage of a potential worldwide audience provides us with a sense of self-importance believing that our opinion is on equal footing with everyone else's. The opposite side of the same coin also holds true. We can easily be plagued with fear, anxiety, and worry about things we are only remotely, if at all, connected to. We desperately need to find balance! A childlike heart feeds on the wisdom and knowledge of the Lord. When we do so, a healthy perspective is realized. We are then in a position to experience the contentment of knowing we are in the protective embrace of the gentler side of our Father.2/20/22Today's devotional in a nutshell:\"Those who sow with tears will reap with songs of joy. Those who go out weeping, carrying seed to sow, will return with songs of joy, carrying sheaves with them.\" - Psalms 126:5\u202d-\u202c6 (NIV)For a baseball fan, a series of losses is excruciating, but there are few greater joys than coming out victorious on the other side of a losing streak. Life throws us curves and even knuckleballs, they are part of proving our worthiness to be counted among the major leaguers. But even the best hitters go through slumps. It's time to consult with the Coach. Take extra time in the batting cage to work out the kinks in your swing. Good hitters eventually find their sweet spot again. Now step up into the box and take your cuts. The game is on the line and it's what you dreamed of and trained for. Remember, the tears of trials water the seeds of the future harvest of joy."

Other times we work our fingers to the bone, expending energy and resources in a flailing attempt to solve an issue, and all we end up with is bony fingers. A wise person comes to the conclusion, in short order, about when a problem is beyond their pay grade. They will turn to God for the answer; and God at the opportune time comes through.

It is the longest psalm, and with rare exception nearly every verse mentions God's revelation through His word. The use of: law of the Lord, statutes, precepts, commandments, decrees, etc., are powerful reminders of the importance of what God says. The Apostle Paul picks up the theme when he writes 1000 years later to his protege, Timothy. \"All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.\" Almost 2,000 years after the last word of Scripture was penned, nothing has changed. The People of God are defined by the Word of God, and the plan of God is revealed in the Scriptures. Therefore, let us inspire one another to be the People of the Book."

Every day, without interruption, we are treated to the morning display of God lifting the curtain of darkness and revealing the beauty of his earthly creation, arrayed in living color.

Sparks, and clusters of stars attract our attention and inspire us to marvel at their beauty.

As the sun dips under the horizon, it has not lost it's shine; it is simply displaying Its splendor to another part of the world awaiting the fulfillment of His promise. Those who look to him are radiant. Arise, shine, for your shame has been taken away, your Light has come. 1/7/2022Today's devotional in a nutshell:\"This poor man called, and the Lord heard him; he saved him out of all his troubles.\" - Psalms 34:6 (NIV)Two-thirds of the world's population lives in poverty. Poverty is crippling. But no poverty is worse than poverty of spirit. The loss of hope, and the depth of despair, are the twin maladies of spiritual insecurity. But poverty can serve a beneficial purpose. It is often in our need where we find ourselves seeking for help outside of our exhausted abilities. When we seek, we will find that God is there. When we're out of choices call out and He will hear. Better yet, call out before the options run out!"

If we believe he is looking for opportunities to lead and guide us into righteousness, then we need not fear him. Begin with the premise that God is good. He is watching over you for your own good.

Since you are my rock and my fortress, for the sake of your name lead and guide me.\" - Psalms 31:2\u202d-\u202c3 (NIV)Most of us have experienced some kind of trouble in our lives. If we haven't, our turn will come soon enough. How we weather the storm often reveals where our faith is. God has staked his name on our rescue and protection. Standing behind the Rock and abiding in his fortress, we are secure. During our time of trouble, look for his guidance and follow his lead."

Being raised in Nazareth in the home of a humble carpenter, Jesus was called a Nazarene, but his true identity came from where he was born. Bethlehem, the city of David, on the outskirts of Jerusalem, was the place of Jesus' birth. He was of royal lineage. Although you may be typecast for being raised in Chicago, New York, LA, or Miami, you are not the product of where you came from. Once you've been born again, your true roots are revealed. You also are royalty. As a child of the King, you are a part of the family of God."

The People of God are not immune. We take orders, defend the gates, march forward to free occupied territory, return to the barracks, put the day behind us, and prep for the next battle. Duty without devotion. When that happens, we are reminded to return to the love that attracted us to the Savior; the love that compelled us to give it all up to follow Him.

Taste and see.\"I will extol the Lord at all times; his praise will always be on my lips. I will glory in the Lord; let the afflicted hear and rejoice. Glorify the Lord with me; let us exalt his name together. I sought the Lord, and he answered me; he delivered me from all my fears. Those who look to him are radiant; their faces are never covered with shame. This poor man called, and the Lord heard him; he saved him out of all his troubles. The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him, and he delivers them.  Taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is the one who takes refuge in him. Fear the Lord, you his holy people, for those who fear him lack nothing. The lions may grow weak and hungry, but those who seek the Lord lack no good thing. Come, my children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord. Whoever of you loves life and desires to see many good days, keep your tongue from evil and your lips from telling lies. Turn from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it. The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears are attentive to their cry;  but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil, to blot out their name from the earth. The righteous cry out, and the Lord hears them; he delivers them from all their troubles. The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit. The righteous person may have many troubles, but the Lord delivers him from them all; he protects all his bones, not one of them will be broken. Evil will slay the wicked; the foes of the righteous will be condemned.  The Lord will rescue his servants; no one who takes refuge in him will be condemned.\" - Psalms 34:1\u202d-\u202c22 (NIV)"

The vast array of societal ills can be directly traced to its cause and effect. \"But God\", two of the most hopeful words in the Bible, has the antidote for sin. If we call on him, individually and collectively, he will surely forgive, cleanse, and heal us, and our land."
